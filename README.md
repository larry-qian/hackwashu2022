## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was the fact that the course listings on WashU WebSTAC absolutely sucks, so we endeavored to make it an easier and better process with this extension that we made.
## What it does
This extension is supposed to scrape your classes from your registration worksheet, and then take those courses, and based on what you already have in your registration worksheet, make possible schedules based on that information. Then, it will put that information onto your screen and allow the user to change their schedule so that it has a schedule that works.
## How we built it
First, we planned out all the parts of the extension that we would need. Then, we started figuring out how each section would work in the extension. First we made a very rudimentary extension, and then started building off of it to make the parts we had planned when we were doing the preliminary planning.  As we (William, Daedalus, and Larry) were working on the code, Skye was working on the UI aspect for the table, making sure that experience would look relatively nice for this extension that we put together. After putting this all together, we finally had the somewhat finished project, which is linked in the github repository below. 

fyi, there are a decent amount of bugs, mostly originating out of the fact that none of us are really used to javascript, so a lot of things that we thought we could do ended up being impossible or very difficult to implement in the way that we would usually implement them in.
## Challenges we ran into
None of us had really used javascript before, so we had to kind of learn very quickly the basics of javascript as we started to create this extension. We learned a decent amt of javascript and definitely have a huge amount of appreciation for people who create these javascript extensions for web browsers in their free time.

Another challenge I think we ran into was the fact that sometimes we would have differing ideas on how to implement things, and that would sometimes affect how we make our code -- a large problem that makes it pretty difficult in some cases to create something that works together.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm very proud that we were able to make an extension like this, even with the bugs, with basically no prior knowledge of how to code something like this.
## What we learned
How to somewhat program in javascript, and not to be too ambitious with our preliminary planning as sometimes it's not really feasible to add into our program with the amount of time we were given to create the extension.
## What's next for catspew
If we have extra time, we'll try to fix the bugs and then add the extra touches that we were thinking about adding. But since midterms are coming up... probably nothing.
