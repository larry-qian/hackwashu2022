## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was the fact that the course listings on WashU WebSTAC absolutely sucks, so we endeavored to make it an easier and better process with this extension that we made.
## What it does

## How we built it
First, we planned out all the parts of the extension that we would need. Then, we started figuring out how each section would work in the extension. First we made a very rudimentary extension, and then started building off of it to make the parts we had planned when we were doing the preliminary planning.  As we (William, Daedalus, and Larry) were working on the code, Skye was working on the UI aspect for the table, making sure that experience would look relatively nice for this extension that we put together. After putting this all together, we finally had the finished project, which is linked in the github repository below.
## Challenges we ran into
None of us had really used javascript before, so we had to kind of learn in a trial by fire as we started to create this extension. We learned a decent amt of javascript and definitely have a newfound appreciation for the people who make extensions for web browsers.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm very proud that we were able to make an extension like this with basically no prior knowledge of how to code something like this.
## What we learned
How to program in javascript, and not to be too ambitious with our preliminary planning as sometimes it's not really feasible to add into our program with the amount of time we were given to create the extension.
## What's next for catspew
We'll probably work on doing some extra touches on the extension, and add the things that we had to cut off due to time constraints.
